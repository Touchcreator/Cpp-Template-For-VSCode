# C++ Template for VSCode
## Background
So I was trying to make a multi-file project in C++ but it was so hard, I got this VSCode extension by Adriano Markovic which helped a little bit, but eventually I created this template which should work for now.
## How to Use
Simple! Put all your files in the `src` directory. (Header files can be anywhere, I think) Then in the command line, run `run.bat`, once your program is running, to exit, if it is a loop, press `Ctrl+C` and `N`. You could also probably press the X button if it's a visual program, but I'm too lazy for that. Your executable should be in the `bin` folder. You can also run `norun.bat` to build an executable without running it.

and no im not making a linux version
